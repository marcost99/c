After execute the command for compilation  (ex.: gcc hello-world.c -o hello-world), the following process are executed:

1 - Preprocessing
  - The preprocessor (a program of system) read the dependencies and create um file (*.i) with all functions and save in the memmory

2 - Compilation
  - The compiler (ex.: GNU GCC) transform the file *.i in a file (*.s) with code in assembler

3 - Assembler
  - The Assembler transform the file *.s in a file of object (*.o). This file contain intructions of language of machine

4 - Linking
  - The Linker (a program separate. ex.: GNU LD) merge all file of object (each function has a file of object specific) and generate the file executable
